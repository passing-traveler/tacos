      <h1>100% Halal Certified</h1>
      <p>
        Halal means “Permissible” in Arabic and refers to the dietary law of
        Islam, which practicing Muslims follow. Similar to Kosher food for the
        Jewish people, Halal food avoids anything derived from swine flesh
        (pork, bacon, lard, gelatin, etc.) as well as alcohol (beer, wine,
        etc.). Animals which are considered Halal include chicken, beef, lamb,
        goat, turkey, deer, and most seafood. In order for the meat to be
        considered Halal the animal must be slaughtered in a way that is quick
        and as painless as possible while a Muslim recites a prayer. After
        slaughtering, the blood is also completely drained out, which produces a
        healthier meat which is more tender and tastier. Usually, but not
        always, the animals used for Halal meat are fed natural grains, grass or
        corn and are not injected with any hormones or harmful chemicals.
